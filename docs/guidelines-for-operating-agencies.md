# Guidelines for Operating Agencies \[Informative\]

Operating agencies should be aware that there are cases where two or
more management applications are potentially able to simultaneously
access the same object. For example, the Global Database Management
group does not prevent multiple management applications from accessing
the data simultaneously. It is the responsibility of any agencies
involved in inter-jurisdictional control to define procedures to ensure
against this situation.
