# History of Changes \[Informative\] {.annex}

Annex D summarizes the changes made between the prior version of NTCIP
8004 and NTCIP 8004 v03.

The migration of NTCIP from SNMPv1 to SNMPv3 required NTCIP 8004 to
migrate from SMIv1 to SMIv2, which required fundamental changes in the
way that NTCIP documents its object types. While the scope of NTCIP 8004
v03 is consistent with the scope of prior versions of NTCIP 8004, the
details and references have changed considerably. The magnitude of this
change resulted in a complete rewrite of the document, including:

1. Updating references
2. Rewriting Section 2 to be consistent with SNMPv3 message structure
    and terminology
3. Rewriting Section 3 to be consistent with the concepts and
    terminology contained in ISO/IEC 9834-1 and to update the node
    assignments under NEMA
4. Rewriting Section 4 to be a profile of the SMIv2 and related IETF
    RFCs
5. Restructuring the document to consolidate all requirements for
    implementations into Section 5
6. Restructuring the document to consolidate guidelines for operating
    agencies into Section 6
7. Revising Annex A to conform with SMIv2 and deprecate items that are
    no longer recommended
8. Adding Annex B to define special rules from converting from SMIv1 to
    SMIv2
9. Updating and consolidating all examples into Annex C
10. Updating Annex D.
