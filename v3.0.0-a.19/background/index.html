<p>Within NTCIP, transportation equipment is managed primarily using the
Simple Network Management Protocol (<abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr>) to exchange transportation
management information with transportation management applications
(e.g., within a central system). This type of exchange is commonly
called Center-to-Field (C2F) communications. Within <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr> terminology,
the transportation equipment includes an <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr> <abbr title="entity that receives requests and transmits responses to the received requests.">agent</abbr> that responds to
requests received from a transportation management application, which is
known as an <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr> management application (or manager). <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr> requests and
responses share a similar structure, which can be depicted in the
Unified Modeling Language (<abbr title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr>), as shown in Figure 1 (with slight
simplifications for the purpose of this discussion).</p>

essAirTemperature. An environmental sensor station might support
multiple temperature sensors; each sensor would be associated with its

potentially with other variable bindings.</p>
<p>In order for the <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol version 3">SNMP</abbr> manager to understand the data contained within

structure and management of this information also allow multiple MIB
modules (e.g., NTCIP standard, Internet standard, manufacturer-specific
extensions) to be used for a single device. The MIB modules are
integrated into the device software and its management stations using
various methods (e.g, implemented directly as data structures in the
software, compiled into binary tables that facilitate use by operational
software). It is common for the MIB modules to be called the MIB but,
technically, this is incorrect. The MIB is the instantiated collection of
data objects available to management stations to configure, control, and
monitor the device. It is not a database in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates how using MIB modules makes NTCIP C2F
communications possible. In this example, the field devices are shown on
the left of the figure with their associated MIB modules. The dynamic
message sign uses only objects defined in standards while the traffic
signal controller includes manufacturer-specific objects. The management
station is commonly called a "central system" in transportation systems.</p>

<p>A conceptual table defines a set of <abbr title='entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.

traditionally be represented in a written document using a table format.
Logically, each conceptual table consists of a number of columns and
rows, where each column describes a particular type of data and each row
represents a unique instance of data for each column. A conceptual table
describes the information contained in the table and the rows that the
table should have. It has a <code>SYNTAX</code> of <code>SEQUENCE OF &lt;EntryType&gt;</code>, where
<code>&lt;EntryType&gt;</code> is the name of the conceptual row's data structure.</p>
<p>A conceptual row defines a set of <abbr title='entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.   NOTE -- See object instance and object type,   both of which are types of objects, along with any other entity that can be identified,  such as a standard.

unit of inter-related management information. The row typically supports
multiple columns and the <abbr title='entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.

been imported from an SMIv1 module. Conceptual leafs can also be defined
when a standard wants to declare data that should be supported by a
device even if it is never exchanged. For example, the trigger function
is required to monitor data within the device and needs to be able to
demonstrate that it has appropriate security credentials to access the
data. The security credential information is stored in non-accessible
objects to indicate that the controller needs to maintain this
information but that the information should never be exchanged.</p>
