<p>The original text of the RFCs is indispensable for a full understanding

conversational/explanatory tone which can result in redundancies and
ambiguities as to the conformance status of each <abbr title="a condition or capability to which a system shall conform">requirement</abbr>. Further,
some requirements in the referenced RFCs are written to only be
applicable to <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> standard MIB modules while others are for
non-standard MIB modules and tend to be from a technical perspective of
what is allowed as opposed to what should be done. The conformance
requirements adopted by NTCIP are intended to establish a policy for
writing NTCIP standard MIB modules and as a result reflect a slightly
different mix of conformance statuses from what the <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> has defined.
Finally, the requirements for developing a <abbr title="sequence of NVT ASCII characters conforming to X.208 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) and IAB STD 58.

multiple RFCs, which describe not only the rules for writing the MIB
modules but also on implications to implementations.</p>
<p>The tables presented in this section clarify and highlight the
conformance status of certain requirements and is limited to those rules
related to writing standard NTCIP MIB modules. Rules that are specified
within X.208 and within the information modules defined within the
referenced RFCs are omitted as they are unambiguous, and no changes are
made. This document focuses on the requirements that are only defined
within the text (non-module) sections of the RFCs.</p>
<p>This document groups requirements by topic, regardless of the source of
the <abbr title="a condition or capability to which a system shall conform">requirement</abbr>. Each <abbr title="a condition or capability to which a system shall conform">requirement</abbr> is listed in a tabular format with an
item number that allows for easy referencing. The tabular format
consists of the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Item: provides a unique identifier for the <abbr title="a condition or capability to which a system shall conform">requirement</abbr>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirement: A <abbr title="a condition or capability to which a system shall conform">requirement</abbr> stated as a \"shall\" statement. This
  almost always requires a rewording of the statement compared with

<p>Requirements for the construction of X.208 modules within NTCIP
standards are shown in Table 6. Most X.208 modules defined within NTCIP
standards are MIB modules (i.e., they use the <abbr title="X.208 ASN.1 macro used to define the meta-attributes of an object type in an SNMP MIB module.">OBJECT-TYPE</abbr> and/or the
NOTIFICATION-TYPE macros). NTCIP standards also include a small number
of other module types, such as the NTCIP8004-NEMA module, contained in
Annex A of this document, which does not include any <abbr title="X.208 ASN.1 macro used to define the meta-attributes of an object type in an SNMP MIB module.">OBJECT-TYPE</abbr> or
NOTIFICATION-TYPE macros. The requirements presented in Table 2 apply to
all X.208 modules contained in NTCIP standards.</p>

<p><abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2578 uses the term “descriptor” to refer to the concepts that X.208 terms a “valuereference” and it appears to be intended to apply to “typereferences” as well.</p>
<p>X.208 requires a valuereference to begin with a lowercase letter and the statement takes the form \&lt;valuereference&gt; \&lt;macro&gt; ::= \&lt;value&gt;. X.208 requires a typereference to begin with an uppercase letter and the statement takes the form \&lt;typereference&gt; ::= \&lt;macro&gt;. For example, the name “essAirTemperature” is a valuereference; the name “DisplayString” is a typereference.</p>
<p>This document defines “descriptor” to mean “either an X.208 valuereference or typereference” to avoid some ambiguities and misleading statements that exist in <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2578. The specific NTCIP requirements for a descriptor are defined in Table 5.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-of-the-module-compliance-macro">Mapping of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-of-the-module-compliance-macro" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Section 3 of <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2580 defines requirements related to the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro. Until a practical benefit can be demonstrated in using such statements, the NTCIP community has decided to document conformance with PRLs, RTMs, MIB compliance tables, and supported range tables. PRLs and RTMs are defined in NTCIP 8002; MIB compliance tables are intended to document how the objects within a MIB have evolved over time; supported range tables are intended to precisely define the minimum required ranges for each <abbr title='entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.   NOTE -- See object instance and object type,   both of which are types of objects, along with any other entity that can be identified,  such as a standard. This document attempts to  use the most precise term within its text to assist in distinguishing among \"object type\" or \"object instance\". The use of the  term \"object\" is typically limited to registering items on the international object  identifier tree.'>object</abbr> for each version of the standard in a relatively concise manner. The MIB compliance and supported range tables should be presented as defined in this clause.</p>
<h4 id="mib-compliance-table">MIB Compliance Table<a class="headerlink" href="#mib-compliance-table" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The top row of the MIB Compliance Table shall provide the column names. The first column shall be labeled "Group" and subsequent columns shall indicate a compliance identifier, which is typically the version number of the standard (e.g., "v03")<sup id="fnref:57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57">52</a></sup>. The first column of second row of the table shall contain the label "Status"; subsequent columns of the second row show indicate the status of each version of the MIB as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>"c" indicates current</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"d" indicates <abbr title="indicates the user need, requirement, dialog, or object is valid in limited circumstances, but has been replaced by another.">deprecated</abbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"o" indicates <abbr title="status value that indicates the definition is no longer valid, was found to be flawed, was redundant, or was not useful.">obsolete</abbr></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, only the latest version would be shown as current, but a standard could use multiple current columns to define different profiles (e.g., NTCIP 1203 could define a vXX profile for CMS and a vXX profile VMS, both of which are current simultaneously). Columns should only be shown as <abbr title="status value that indicates the definition is no longer valid, was found to be flawed, was redundant, or was not useful.">obsolete</abbr> once all implementations are believed to be removed from service.</p>

The subsequent columns shall show the conformance status of the group as defined for the indicated version of the standard; conformance shall be shown using the conformance symbols as defined for use within PRLs. Finally, any cell within the table can be associated with a note via a reference symbol (e.g., "[1]"). The text of the notes shall appear immediately after the table.</p>
<p>Values within a column shall not be changed, except to correct typos or to change the status of the MIB version (i.e., as recorded in row 2). MIB versions that were previously documented as <abbr title="status value that indicates the definition is no longer valid, was found to be flawed, was redundant, or was not useful.">obsolete</abbr> in a previous version of the standard can be omitted from the table. Each version of the standard should add at least one new column.</p>

NOTE -- See object instance and object type,   both of which are types of objects, along with any other entity that can be identified,  such as a standard.

<p>To conform to the SMIv2 format, all NTCIP standards should include a supported range table to indicate the intent of supported ranges so that implementations (especially manger implementations) can manage expectations of what values might be supported.
