This type of exchange is commonly called Center-to-Field (C2F) communications. Within SNMP terminology, the transportation equipment includes an SNMP agent that responds to requests received from a transportation management application, which is known as an SNMP management application (or manager). SNMP requests and responses share a similar structure, which can be depicted in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), as shown in Figure 1 (with slight simplifications for the purpose of this discussion).</p> <p>{width=\"6.352777777777778in\" height=\"3.9833333333333334in\"}</p> <p>Starting in the upper-left corner of Figure 1, a message is the logical SNMP structure that is serialized as a data packet (i.e., byte-stream) and exchanged by lower-layer protocol entities (e.g., TCP/IP). It consists of a variety of information, such as protocol header, version information, security parameters, and a potentially encrypted scoped protocol data unit (PDU). The scoped PDU includes the context for the message, error information, the request identifier, and a series of variable bindings represented as a name/value ordered pair. Within this structure, each variable binding (i.e., name/value ordered pair) is the serialized representation of an object instance stored within the identified SNMP context. An object instance is an instance of a defined object type, which is a formal abstract definition of a piece of data.</p> <p>For example (in reverse order), NTCIP 1204, which defines data for environmental sensor stations, defines an object type called essAirTemperature. An environmental sensor station might support multiple temperature sensors; each sensor would be associated with its own instance of the object type, identified as \"essAirTemperature.\\&lt;sensor number&gt;\". An SNMP agent could report the value of any object instance by creating an ordered pair of the name and value of the object instance and enclosing it in an SNMP message, potentially with other variable bindings.</p> <p>In order for the SNMP manager to understand the data contained within each message, the SNMP manager and SNMP agent must agree on:</p> <p>a)  a mechanism to unambiguously identify the object type and object     instance,</p> <p>b)  the precise semantics (i.e., meaning) of the data value,</p> <p>c)  the way in which the data will be encoded,</p> <p>d)  the operations that are allowed (e.g., can a manager alter the value     or is it read-only), and</p> <p>e)  the data that should be supported.</p> <p>These details are specified using a formalized ASCII-NVT text file known as a Management Information Base (MIB) module coupled with the definition of SNMP, as defined in RFCs 2578-2580 and RFCs 3411- 3418.</p>"},{"location":"background/#management-information-base-mib-and-module","title":"Management Information Base (MIB) and Module","text":"<p>A Management Information Base (MIB) is the information that a specific SNMP context (typically a device) can make available for management operations. A MIB is defined by a text-based \"MIB Module\" (or collection of MIB Modules) that specifies the collection of object types that that the device supports. A MIB module is written using formal conventions in a structure that can read by both humans and computers. Object types include controls, configuration parameters, and status information (including sensor values and internal device status). Any data that is to be accessible via SNMP must be defined in a MIB module.</p> <p>The standardized format of a MIB module allows automating much of the syntactic processing of data with off-the-shelf SNMP tools and allows developers to focus on implementing the semantics according to the documented definitions contained with the MIB module. The rules for the structure and management of this information also allow multiple MIB modules (e.g., NTCIP standard, Internet standard, manufacturer-specific extensions) to be used for a single device. The MIB modules are integrated into the device software and its management stations using various methods (e.g, implemented directly as data structures in the software, compiled into binary tables that facilitate use by operational software). It is common for the MIB modules to be called the MIB but, technically, this is incorrect. The MIB is the instatiated collection of data objects available to management stations to configure, control, and monitor the device. It is not a database in the traditional sense.</p> <p>Figure 2 illustrates how using MIB modules makes NTCIP C2F communications possible. In this example, the field devices are shown on the left of the figure with their associated MIB modules. The dynamic message sign uses only objects defined in standards while the traffic signal controller includes manufacturer-specific objects. The management station is commonly called a \"central system\" in transportation systems.</p> <p>{width=\"5.909722222222222in\" height=\"4.565277777777778in\"}</p> <p>Integrated MIB Modules Make NTCIP C2F Communications Possible</p>"},{"location":"background/#types-of-object-types","title":"Types of Object Types","text":"<p>Within SNMP, each piece of management information that can be exchanged is called an object instance.

The sub-identifiers for leaf object types are reserved for the identification of specific instances of the object type; they are only unique within the indicated device context (e.g., the object type sysName is a leaf object type and has a globally unique identifier; however, every SNMP device that instantiates this object type will use the same instance identifier). Leaf objects can be further classified in three different ways:</p> <p>a)  Based on whether multiple instances are allowed,</p> <p>b)  Based on the complexity of the underlying data, and</p> <p>c)  Based on the types of operations that are permitted.</p>"},{"location":"background/#classification-by-instantiation-rules","title":"Classification by Instantiation Rules","text":"<p>If a leaf object type is defined as a part of a conceptual row of a table, multiple instances of the object are allowed, one for each row that has been conceptually instantiated within the table. This type of leaf object type is known as a \\\"columnar object type\\\". The different instances of the columnar object type are defined according to the mechanism defined by the INDEX clause of the conceptual row using one or more sub-identifiers.</p> <p>If a leaf object type is not defined as a part of a conceptual table, only one instance of the object can exist; this object type if called a \\\"scalar object type\\\". The singular instance of a scalar object type is always identified by the single sub-identifier instance number of \"0\".</p>"},{"location":"background/#complexity-of-object-types","title":"Complexity of Object Types","text":"<p>SNMP was designed to exchange elemental data; as such, leaf object types are not allowed to directly use any ASN.1 data structure (e.g., SEQUENCE, SEQUENCE OF, CHOICE) for its syntax. This allows SNMP to provide very flexible data exchanges based on the need of the user. However, within a message, each elemental object instance must be uniquely identified, which adds overhead.</p> <p>Within NTCIP, there are often needs to frequently exchange the same set of object instances in environments where the amount of data that is exchanged is a concern (e.g., communication environments with data usage limitations). These environments result in a need for a more efficient solution than always exchanging data in its most elemental form. To overcome these issues, the NTCIP classifies every leaf object type as a simple, block, or configurable object type.</p> <p>Simple object types represent elemental data, as traditionally defined with normal SNMP operations. Simple object types include integers, octet strings, object identifiers, bit strings, and other types that derive from these basic types.</p> <p>Block object types represent data structures (e.g., SEQUENCE, SEQUENCE OF, CHOICE) that are normally prohibited as SNMP object types. NTCIP gets around the SNMP prohibition by setting the SYNTAX clause of the OBJECT-TYPE macro to resove to an OCTET STRING (typically by using a textual convention). It then defines the value of that OCTET STRING to be a serialization of a defined data structure. From the SNMP perspective, the data is an elemental OCTET STRING, but the sender and receiver perform additional encoding and decoding to allow for the exchange of a more complex structure. Within NTCIP, the preferred way to define the serialization of these data structures is by using an ITSOerString, which is defined by ISO 20684-1 as a data structure specified using X.680 ASN.1 and serialized using the Octet Encoding Rules (OER).</p> <p>Configurable object types are similar to block objects in that each configurable object represents a data structure that can be serialized into an OCTET STRING and then be exchanged as a single SNMP object type. However, block object types have static definitions of their data structures defined within the MIB module. By comparison, configurable object types allow for a manager to configure the definition of the data structure after the implementation has been deployed and while the SNMP agent is running. Within NTCIP, configurable object types are typically SEQUENCE structures and the configuration is typically defined in a table where each ordered row of the table represents an ordered ComponentType (i.e., field) within the SEQUENCE structure. The serialization of the configurable object typically uses OER to produce an OCTET STRING that can be exchanged by SNMP.</p>"},{"location":"background/#object-type-permissions","title":"Object Type Permissions","text":"<p>SNMP object types can also be classified based on the types of data represented and the operations that are allowed under different scenarios. There are four basic types of object types from this perspective, as follows:</p> <p>a)  Status object types. Read-only objects that report the conditions     that can be monitored by the SNMP agent.</p> <p>b)  Control object types. Writeable object types used to request     real-time activation of a feature of a device. In some cases,     control objects can also be used to report status.</p> <p>c)  Parameter object types. Writeable object types used to configure the     SNMP agent where the parameter can be set and validated using a     single SNMP set operation.</p> <p>d)  Interrelated parameter object types. Writeable object types used to     configure the SNMP agent where the parameter has sufficient     interrelationships with other object types to typically require     multiple SNMP set operations using multiple SetRequest messages or a     complex validation check that might consume more time than is     reasonable for a traditional SNMP response.</p> <p>When a device includes interrelated parameter object types, it defines a mechanism by which the object types can be safely configured. One such approach is to use the database transaction mode as specified in NTCIP 1201.</p>"},{"location":"background/#conceptual-objects","title":"Conceptual Objects","text":"<p>In addition to the leaf object types described above, MIB modules can define three types of conceptual object types: conceptual tables, conceptual rows, conceptual leafs. Conceptual objects can theoretically be instantiated but because they have a MAX-ACCESS value of \\\"not-accessible\\\", the rules of SNMP do not allow their exchange and they do not really exist as protocol entities. An implementation can only exchange instances of the accessible object types.</p> <p>A conceptual table defines a set of object types that might traditionally be represented in a written document using a table format. Logically, each conceptual table consists of a number of columns and rows, where each column describes a particular type of data and each row represents a unique instance of data for each column. A conceptual table describes the information contained in the table and the rows that the table should have. It has a SYNTAX of \"SEQUENCE OF \\&lt;EntryType&gt;\", where \\&lt;EntryType&gt; is the name of the conceptual row's data structure.</p> <p>A conceptual row defines a set of object types that represent a logical unit of inter-related management information. The row typically supports multiple columns and the object types referenced by that row logically has one instance for each defined row. The row object type defines the rules for the number of rows and the rules for creation and deletion of rows.</p> <p>A conceptual leaf is a simple object type that has been identified as \\\"not-accessible\\\"; for example an index to a table. While SMIv1 allowed for index object types to be accessible, it provides no real value and increases the time it takes to walk through the data (i.e., by using GetNextRequests) supported by the SNMP agent. As a result, SMIv2 prohibits index object types from being accessible, unless they have been imported from an SMIv1 module. Conceptual leafs can also be defined when a standard wants to declare data that should be supported by a device even if it is never exchanged. For example, the trigger function is required to monitor data within the device and needs to be able to demonstrate that it has appropriate security credentials to access the data. The security credential information is stored in non-accessible objects to indicate that the controller needs to maintain this information but that the information should never be exchanged.</p>"},{"location":"background/#document-overview","title":"Document Overview","text":"<p>The remaining sections of this document define:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The mechanism used to allow multiple independent entities to define     object types while maintaining globally unique names</p> </li> <li> <p>Requirements for the development of MIB modules</p> </li> <li> <p>Requirements for agent implementations</p> </li> <li> <p>Considerations for operating agencies</p> </li> </ol> <p>In addition, Annex A provides the formal definition of the NTCIP 8004 MIB, which must be imported by all other NTCIP MIBs and Annex B provides the rules for converting NTCIP MIBs that are based on SMIv1 into the SMIv2 format required by this document.</p>"},{"location":"foreword/","title":"Foreword","text":""},{"location":"foreword/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This document is an NTCIP Open-Source NTCIP Process, Control, and Information Management document provided as Interim for Field Release (IFR).</p> <p>Open-source documents are developed using the ITS Open-Source Process, as defined in NTCIP 8008.

Typically, these are tasks that are not yet assigned to a developer and are waiting to be worked on. Sometimes, these could be tasks that were open weeks or months ago and are still waiting to be worked on.</p> branch A branch is a separate version of the code that's created for development purposes. Branches allow contributors to experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase. When changes are ready to be merged into the main codebase, they're typically submitted as a pull request. bug A bug refers to an error, flaw, or defect in code that adversely affects the proper functioning of the software. Open source projects often depend on contributions from the community to identify and rectify these bugs. <p>clone: Cloning is the process used to copy an existing Git repository into a new local directory. The <code>git clone</code> command will create a new local directory for the repository, copy all the contents of the specified repository, create the remote tracked branches, and checkout an initial branch locally. By default, Git clone will create a reference to the remote repository called origin.</p> <p>code freeze: A code freeze is a period of time where no new code is added to a project. It is often used to prepare for a release and ensure that the code is stable and ready for production.</p> <p>code review: A code review is when a maintainer or contributor will review the work of another contributor. This is a great way to ensure that the code is high quality and meets the standards of the project.</p> <p>containerization: Containerization is a way of packaging and running applications. Instead of installing an app directly on your computer, you put it in a container that includes everything it needs to work. This container can then run on your computer alongside other containers. It's a way to organize and run multiple applications on the same machine, making it easier for developers to manage and scale their applications.</p> <p>continuous integration (CI): Continuous integration (CI) is a development approach in which developers regularly merge code into a shared repository. For each change, an automated build and test process is run to detect errors as quickly as possible.</p> <p>continuous deployment (CD): Continuous deployment (CD) is often associated with continuous integration (CI) and refers to keeping your application deployable at any point or even automatically releasing to production. CD means that every change which passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically.</p> <p>contributor: A contributor is anyone who makes changes, additions, or suggestions to an open source project. Contributors can be developers, designers, writers, testers, or anyone else who helps to make the project better.</p> <p>core member: A core member is a contributor who has been granted additional privileges or responsibilities within an open source project. Core members are typically trusted contributors who have demonstrated a deep understanding of the project and have made significant contributions to its development.</p> <p>docs: Docs is an abbreviation for \"documentation\". It primarily explains how to implement and use a product or an open source project. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and expectations for contributors. Documentation is often written using Markdown, a lightweight markup language.</p> <p>fork: A fork is a copy of a repository. When you fork a repository, you create a new copy of the codebase that you can modify and experiment with without affecting the original codebase.</p> <p>GitHub actions: GitHub Actions are a way to automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. Examples of GitHub Actions include running tests, deploying to production, and sending notifications.</p> <p>GitHub discussions: GitHub Discussions are a way to have conversations about your project directly in GitHub. They are a great way to discuss ideas, ask questions, and share knowledge with your community.</p> <p>issue: An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code. Issues can be created by anyone, and they're often used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks that need to be done.</p> <p>linting: Linting is the process of running a program that will analyze code for potential errors. A popular linting tool used frequently is ESLint. You can setup an action to run ESlint against each pull request that comes in to check for potential errors before it makes it into production.</p> <p>maintainer: A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open source project. Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors. They also have the authority to make final decisions about the direction and scope of the project.</p> <p>markdown: Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for creating formatted text documents. It is widely used for creating documentation and README files in software development due to its simplicity and readability.</p> <p>merge: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. When a pull request is accepted and merged, the changes made in the pull request become part of the main codebase.</p> <p>onboarding: Onboarding documentation helps new team members or collaborators quickly become familiar with a project's structure, goals, and processes.</p> <p>OSS Projects: OSS stands for \"Open Source Software\" projects. These are software projects where the source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use and modify the software.</p> <p>pull request: A pull request is a request from a contributor to a maintainer for changes made to the code to be pulled into a codebase.</p> <p>quality assurance: Quality assurance in open source projects involves testing, reviewing, and ensuring the software meets the desired standards. Community members often contribute to testing and reporting issues to improve the software's quality.</p> <p>release candidate: A release candidate is a beta version of software with the potential to be a final product. It is typically the last version before the final release.</p> <p>release notes: Release notes are documents that detail changes, enhancements, bug fixes, and new features in each software release. They inform users and stakeholders about what to expect in a new version of the software.</p> <p>repository: A repository is a central location where code is stored and managed. In open source, repositories are often hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Each repository can contain one or more projects, and contributors can submit changes to the code by making pull requests.</p> <p>style guide: A style guide is a set of rules and conventions that define the preferred formatting, writing style, and visual elements used in documentation and other content. This helps maintain consistency and clarity across documents, making them easier to read and understand.</p> <p>versioning: Versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or numbers to new releases of your project. Some versions are released as \"major\" versions, while others are released as \"minor\" versions.</p>"},{"location":"guidelines-for-operating-agencies/","title":"Guidelines for Operating Agencies [Informative]","text":"<p>Operating agencies should be aware that there are cases where two or more management applications are potentially able to simultaneously access the same object.

Allowing this combination of object types presents a potential for naming conflicts (i.e., two sources defining different pieces of data using the same name). SNMP overcomes this challenge by identifying object types using the international object identifier tree, as defined by the ISO/IEC 9834-1 standard.</p>"},{"location":"object-identification/#international-object-identifier-tree","title":"International Object Identifier Tree","text":"<p>The international object identifier tree consists of three root nodes[^3]. Each root node can be assigned multiple sub-nodes. Each sub-node may, in turn, have sub-nodes of its own.</p> <p>Each node, whether a root node or a sub-node, is managed by some organization. For example, the three root nodes are managed by ISO, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), and jointly by ISO and ITU-T. The manager of any node may delegate the management responsibility for any sub-node underneath its branch. In this case, the delegated node is termed a subtree. Just as any sub-node may have its own set of sub-nodes, subtrees can have their own subtrees.</p> <p>Except for the first two root nodes (which are limited to 40 sub-nodes each), the number of sub-nodes that any node may have is unlimited. Likewise, the number of sub-node levels is unlimited. As a result, the international object identifier tree can contain an unlimited number of nodes using a tree structure managed by multiple organizations.[^4]</p>"},{"location":"object-identification/#node-identification","title":"Node Identification","text":"<p>Each node is assigned an integral number and optionally a label. The label is called the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR and provides a user-friendly textual name that can concisely express what the node is intended to represent. While the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR provides a useful human-language term to describe the node and should be designed to be unique within the scope of other sibling nodes of the same branch and level, there is no guarantee that it is unique within the entire international object identifier tree. Nonetheless, any node can be uniquely defined by following the sequence of nodes from the root to the specific node that needs to be identified. Unfortunately, this can produce a rather lengthy description since each name might consist of several characters. Alternatively, the same identifier can be produced by using the integral numbers assigned to each node rather than the OBJECT DESCRIPTORs. This representation typically results in a much more compact identifier that can more easily be processed by computers. This ordered list of integral values is called an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is known to identify a globally unique position on the identifier tree when properly registered.</p> <p>The globally unique identifier can be used for any purpose for which an identifier may be useful. For example, most standards organizations have been assigned an OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the purposes of identification. The tree can also be used for managing groups of related data. For example, all objects related to an Actuated Signal Controller are organized under a node defined as 'asc'. In short, these attributes are a means for identifying some object, regardless of the semantics associated with the object.</p>"},{"location":"object-identification/#object-identifiers-and-snmp","title":"Object Identifiers and SNMP","text":"<p>Within SNMP, the international object identifier tree is used to register object types with globally unique identifiers. The formal assignment of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to each object type is contained in the MIB module.</p> <p>SNMP also identifies object instances by using the international object identifier tree, but with a slight twist in that the instance portion of the identifier is only unique within its SNMP agent and context[^5] -- not globally unique. For example, while the MIB provides a globally unique identifier for the object type of essAirTemperature, there might be multiple environmental sensor stations each containing multiple air temperature sensors. To identify a specific object instance within a specific environmental sensor station, SNMP extends the object type object identifier with an instance identifier (e.g., essAirTemperature.1 to identify the reading from the first sensor). However, the instance value is not unique across different SNMP agents (i.e., every environmental sensor station will use essAirTemperature.1 to identify the reading from its first air temperature sensor). The SNMP manager is responsible for distinguishing among these readings by combining the object instance identifier with the network address of the device and the context used within the message.</p>"},{"location":"object-identification/#registered-nodes","title":"Registered Nodes","text":""},{"location":"object-identification/#root-nodes","title":"Root Nodes","text":"<p>The first two root nodes of the naming tree are administered by ITU-T (itu-t) and ISO (iso).

The subsequent columns shall show the conformance status of the group as defined for the indicated version of the standard; conformance shall be shown using the conformance symbols as defined for use within PRLs. Finally, any cell within the table can be associated with a note via a reference symbol (e.g., \\\"[1]\\\"). The text of the notes shall appear immediately after the table.</p> <p>Values within a column shall not be changed, except to correct typos or to change the status of the MIB version (i.e., as recorded in row 2). MIB versions that were previously documented as obsolete in a previous version of the standard can be omitted from the table. Each version of the standard should add at least one new column.</p> <p>Table 28 provides an example of a MIB compliance table.</p> <pre><code>                        Group   v01          v02              v03            v04-VMS          v04-CMS\n</code></pre> <pre><code>               Version Status    o            d                d                c                c\n\n               dmsTypeGroupR1    M            M                M                M                M\n\n         dmsTechnologyGroupR1  O.1(2)         M                M                M                M\n\ndmsDisplayCapabilitiesGroupR1  O.1(2)   Capabilities:M   Capabilities:M   Capabilities:M   Capabilities:M\n\n    dmsVmsCapabilitiesGroupR1               VMS:M            VMS:M              M\n\n               dmsFontGroupR1   O.2        Fonts:M          Fonts:M          Fonts:M          Fonts:M\n\n            dmsFontGroupR1Ext              Fonts:M          Fonts:M          Fonts:M          Fonts:M\n</code></pre> Table 28: Example MIB Compliance Table (based on a draft of NTCIP   1203)"},{"location":"rules-for-module-development/#supported-range-table","title":"Supported Range Table","text":"<p>MIB modules define the standardized allowed syntax for each object type; however, there are cases where the intent is to allow implementations to subrange the standardized syntax. Within prior versions of NTCIP (i.e., those based on SMIv1), the default policy was that implementations were allowed to subrange any object unless otherwise indicated. In general, the NTCIP standards were rather lax in stating these exceptions. Within SMIv2 (and specifically RFC 2580), the default is that implementations are required to support the full standardized range unless otherwise indicated.</p> <p>To conform to the SMIv2 format, all NTCIP standards should include a supported range table to indicate the intent of supported ranges so that implementations (especially manger implementations) can manage expectations of what values might be supported. Specifically, these tables shall identify the minimum requirements for claiming support for an object and shall describe any conditional support rules.</p> <p>The supported range table shall indicate the following columns in the header row:</p> <ol> <li> <p>An \\\"Obj\\\" column that lists the descriptor of each object type in     the MIB module for which implementations are not required to support     the full range of values.</p> </li> <li> <p>A \\\"Versions\\\" column that identifies the compliance statements to     which the refinement applies (this is typically just a version     number but could include a version number coupled with a profile     name).</p> </li> <li> <p>A \\\"Refinement\\\" column that identifies the allowed variations in     the object type that implementations are allowed to impose.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The first row of the table shall list the column headings. Subsequent rows are presented in groups, with each group consisting of one row that displays the object descriptor across an entire row of the table followed by one or more rows where each subsequent row list one or more versions and the refinement specification that applies to the object type for the indicated versions. The refinement specification shall be documented according to the Object construct defined within the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro in Section 2 of RFC 2580, but omitting the \\'\\\"OBJECT\\\" value(ObjectName)\\' portion.</p> <p>Table 29 provides an example of an object refinement table.</p> +-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+ | Obj                     | Versions                | Refinement                                             | +=========================+=========================+========================================================+ | dmsMessageMemoryType                                                                                       | +-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+ |                         | v01                     | SYNTAX INTEGER {\\                                      | |                         |                         | currentBuffer (5) }                                    | |                         |                         |                                                        | |                         |                         | DESCRIPTION \\\"The value of \\'other\\' is reserved for   | |                         |                         | manufacturer specific use and is not expected to be    | |                         |                         | widely used.

This     means that Bit 0 is the high-order bit of the first octet in the     serialization.</p> <p>c)  If the SYNTAX is based on an integer type (e.g., Integer32), which     is only allowed for object types converted from SMIv1, Bit 0 shall     represent the low-order bit. This means that Bit 0 is the low-order     bit of the last octet in the serialization.</p> <p>d)  If the SYNTAX is based on one of the NTCIP octet-string-based bitmap     textual conventions (e.g., NtcipOctetBitmap8, NtcipOctetBitmap16),     which are only allowed for object types converted from SMIv1, Bit 0     shall be mapped to the lowest order bit of the final octet. This     means that Bit 0 is the low-order bit of the last octet in the     serialization.</p> <p>e)  If the SYNTAX is based on an OCTET STRING, which is only allowed for     object types converted from SMIv1, the mapping of bit numbers to the     bits within the serialization shall be defined within the \\&lt;Format&gt;     subclause of the DESCRIPTION clause of the object type.</p> <p>Figure 5 depicts the impact of the above rules for an example object type with 14 bits defined (resulting in two bits of padding that might not be explicitly defined). Although new objects using bitmaps should use the BITS construct standardized by RFC 2578, older objects converted from SMIv1 might still use one of the other constructs.</p> <p>+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | BITS                                                                                                                                                            | +===========+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+:============:+ | Syntax    | 0            | \u25cf            | \u25cf            | \u25cf            | 7            | 8            | \u25cf            | 14           | pad          | pad          | | Bit #

In addition, it is strongly recommended that the enterprise also register its transportation devices under this subtree, to provide an unambiguous identification mechanism for use in management protocols. For example, if the \\\"ABC, Inc.\\\" enterprise produced transportation devices, then it could request a node under the nemaPrivate node from NEMA. Such a node might be numbered: 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.3.99</p> <p>The \\'ABC, Inc.\\' enterprise might then register their \\\"Widget Controller\\\" under the name of 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.3.99.1, ensuring a unique identification.
